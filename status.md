#### What have you done for your project so far?

Actually, this is our capstone project, and all the members are in the class, and we decided to do it together.
Furthermore, we decided that since our Capstone project involves highly electrical and mechanical engineering principles.
It requires extensive coding. Today, we completed the hardware and wrote code for the boat motor and the boat servo, and it worked.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

We have to connect the ESP32 via Wi-Fi to the joystick we built in the last semester. We rebuilt and recoded it.
Now we need to recode and connect to the boat, then we will be done.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Nothing so far, but I know there will be a significant problem on the line.
