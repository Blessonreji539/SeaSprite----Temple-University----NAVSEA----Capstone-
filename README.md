# SeaSprite----Temple-University----NAVSEA----Capstone-
This project originated from a previous project conducted at Temple University, specifically the flight simulator. That project involved conducting, testing, and building the Joystick that we will be using for this project. This project aims to design a water rover that can navigate through a series of obstacles and reach the other side.
