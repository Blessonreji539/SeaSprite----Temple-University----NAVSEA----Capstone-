# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

SeaSprite - Capstone Project – Naval Surface Warfare Center Collaboration   
 
## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

This multi-year engineering capstone project is conducted in partnership with the Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWCPD) and the Temple University College of Engineering. The project focuses on transforming a remotely operated boat into a digitalized and programmable system. Using an ESP32 microcontroller, the team is developing signal processing, wireless communication, and motor control to enable precise movement and remote operation of the vessel.
The main goal for this semester is to digitize and modernize the boat’s control system by integrating Wi-Fi-based communication, code-driven propulsion control, and onboard sensors for real-time operation and testing.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Make the boat move in X, Y, -X, -Y, Z, and -Z. Also, make the JoyStick to connect to the Boat.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Capstone - College Of Engineering  - ENGT 4196

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Jabbar Lewis	tuo63349@temple.edu

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

-> To make the Boat move in the direction above
-> To connect the Boat Via Wifi
-> to digitize the Boat via a microprocessor.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

No choice, we need to make the project work. It's also our capstone. Additionally, we are going to test it, but the better outcome is that we make the boat at least work. We got the Wi-Fi working and are digitizing it. The only thing left is to make the boat code and test it.


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

-> make the code work and make the boat move in the direction

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?


To get better at coding in a different language and troubleshooting. These are the two main skills I will acquire in this class and project. In this project, we will be researching signals and transmission. Our main topic for the project is to ensure that the signals are correctly aligned.
